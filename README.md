# My Claude Code Setup

> **Work in progress.** This is a guide for using Claude Code to write slides for beamer and to produce research. 


**Live site:** [https://github.com/nemmerel/claude-workflow](https://github.com/nemmerel/claude-workflow)

A ready-to-fork starter kit for academics using [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) with **LaTeX/Beamer + Stata**. You describe what you want; Claude plans the approach, runs specialized agents, fixes issues, verifies quality, and presents results — like a contractor who handles the entire job. 

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub (click "Fork" on the repo page), then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-workflow.git my-project
cd my-project
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Start Claude Code and Paste This Prompt

```bash
claude
```

**Using VS Code? I highly recommend that you do** Open the terminal in VS Code, and type claude. 

Then paste the following, filling in your project details:

> I am starting to work on **[PROJECT NAME]** in this repo. **[Describe your project in 2–3 sentences — what you're building, who it's for, what tools you use.]**
>
> I want our collaboration to be structured, precise, and rigorous. When creating visuals, everything must be polished and publication-ready.
>
> I've set up the Claude Code academic workflow (forked from `https://github.com/nemmerel/claude-workflow`). The configuration files are already in this repo. Please read them, understand the workflow, and then **update all configuration files to fit my project** — fill in placeholders in `CLAUDE.md`, adjust rules if needed, and propose any customizations specific to my use case.
>
> After that, use the plan-first workflow for all non-trivial tasks. Once I approve a plan, switch to contractor mode — coordinate everything autonomously and only come back to me when there's ambiguity or a decision to make.
>
> Enter plan mode and start by adapting the workflow configuration for this project.

**What this does:** Claude reads all the configuration files, fills in your project name, institution, and preferences, then enters contractor mode — planning, implementing, reviewing, and verifying autonomously. You approve the plan and Claude handles the rest.

**Prefer to configure manually?** See the [full guide](https://github.com/nemmerel/claude-workflow/blob/main/guide/workflow-guide.html#sec-setup) for step-by-step manual setup instructions.

## How It Works

### Contractor Mode

You describe a task. Claude plans the approach, implements it, runs specialized review agents, fixes issues, re-verifies, and scores against quality gates — all autonomously. You see a summary when the work meets quality standards. Say "just do it" and it auto-commits too.

### Specialized Agents

Instead of one general-purpose reviewer, 10 focused agents each check one dimension:

- **proofreader** — grammar/typos
- **slide-auditor** — visual layout
- **pedagogy-reviewer** — teaching quality
- **stata-reviewer** — Stata code quality
- **domain-reviewer** — field-specific correctness (template — customize for your field)

Each is better at its narrow task than a generalist would be. The `/slide-excellence` skill runs them all in parallel.

### Adversarial QA

Two agents work in opposition: the **critic** reads the Beamer and produces harsh findings. The **fixer** implements exactly what the critic found. They loop until the critic says "APPROVED" (or 5 rounds max). This catches errors that single-pass review misses.

### Quality Gates

Every file gets a score (0–100). Scores below threshold block the action:
- **80** — commit threshold
- **90** — PR threshold
- **95** — excellence (aspirational)

## The Guide

For a comprehensive walkthrough, read the **[full guide] (workflow_guide.html)

It covers:
1. **Why This Workflow Exists** — the problem and the vision
2. **Getting Started** — fork, paste one prompt, and Claude sets up the rest
3. **The System in Action** — specialized agents, adversarial QA, quality scoring
4. **The Building Blocks** — CLAUDE.md, rules, skills, agents, hooks, memory
5. **Workflow Patterns** — lecture creation, translation, replication, multi-agent review, research exploration
6. **Customizing for Your Domain** — creating your own reviewers and knowledge bases

### Rules (`.claude/rules/`)

Rules use path-scoped loading: **always-on** rules load every session (~100 lines total); **path-scoped** rules load only when Claude works on matching files. Claude follows ~150 instructions reliably, so less is more.

**Always-on** (no `paths:` frontmatter — load every session):

| Rule | What It Enforces |
|------|-----------------|
| `plan-first-workflow` | Plan mode for non-trivial tasks + context preservation |
| `orchestrator-protocol` | Contractor mode: implement → verify → review → fix → score |
| `session-logging` | Three logging triggers: post-plan, incremental, end-of-session |

**Path-scoped** (load only when working on matching files):

| Rule | Triggers On | What It Enforces |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| `verification-protocol` | `.tex`, `.qmd`, `docs/` | Task completion checklist |
| `single-source-of-truth` | `Figures/`, `.tex`, `.qmd` | No content duplication; Beamer is authoritative |
| `quality-gates` | `.tex`, `.qmd`, `*.R` | 80/90/95 scoring + tolerance thresholds |
| `r-code-conventions` | `*.R` | R coding standards + math line-length exception |
| `tikz-visual-quality` | `.tex` | TikZ diagram visual standards |
| `beamer-quarto-sync` | `.tex`, `.qmd` | Auto-sync Beamer edits to Quarto |
| `pdf-processing` | `master_supporting_docs/` | Safe large PDF handling |
| `proofreading-protocol` | `.tex`, `.qmd`, `quality_reports/` | Propose-first, then apply with approval |
| `no-pause-beamer` | `.tex` | No overlay commands in Beamer |
| `replication-protocol` | `*.R` | Replicate original results before extending |
| `knowledge-base-template` | `.tex`, `.qmd`, `*.R` | Notation/application registry template |
| `orchestrator-research` | `*.R`, `explorations/` | Simple orchestrator for research (no multi-round reviews) |
| `exploration-folder-protocol` | `explorations/` | Structured sandbox for experimental work |

## Origin

This infrastructure was extracted from **Econ 730: Causal Panel Data** at Emory University, developed by Pedro Sant'Anna using Claude Code over 6+ sessions. The course produced 6 complete PhD lecture decks with 800+ slides, interactive Quarto versions with plotly charts, and full R replication packages — all managed through this multi-agent workflow.
